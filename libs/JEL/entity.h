 * Entities are simply numbers
 * They are weak references, which is why some bits will go
 * to their index, and some for their generation
 *
 * A generation is when an index has to be re-used
 *
 * All the entities will be stored in an array,
 * and will be managed through JEL_EntityManager
 *
 * The reason for two typdefs is to distinguish
 * what is an integer the same size as an entity,
 * and what is an entity itself.
 *
 * It is typedef-ed because you don't need to
 * use a uint32_t, you could do a uint64_t or
 * uint16_t
