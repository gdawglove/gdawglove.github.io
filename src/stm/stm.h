/*
 * STATE
 *
 * A game state, like menu, game, pause
 *
 * States have updates and draws, input is not
 * handled
 *
 * The actual functions for create and destroy
 * are for initializing and destroying the struct
 * (this is handled by the table), while the 
 * callbacks are for when they are created and
 * destroyed on the stack.
 *
 * The state data should persist in memory as long as
 * the state is alive. If you need to communicate
 * data between states, a resource is probably needed.
 *
 * The create callback is called on a push,
 * and the destroy callback is called on a pop
